    "Recurring deposits are great for people who want to keep some savings.",
    "Some are fixed and others are recurring i.e. fixed deposits involve a bundle of money that is not to be withdrawn for a specific period of time whereas recurring deposits are deposited on a regular basis but also require patience until maturity.",
    "This is advantageous only if your regular income is sufficient knowing you won’t require the funds deposited."
