When you say yes to cookies or purchase items, your preferences for purchase on shopping sites are stored as  information, along with details like your location, gender, address, age and so on. Then companies buy ads on socials such as Facebook and Google. They customise ads to show you knowing you’d like them. This is how sellers gather your data and use it for specified ads."
