    "The value of a product varies from time to time. For e.g. you might value a newly released book by your favourite author more than a year after its first sale. Similarly, you would hold high value for a lost mobile charger while travelling, but not so much if you were to lose it while at home.",
    "The value of a product or service is directly related to the supply of the product and the demand among its buyers. For e.g. a product in shortage has a higher value than something that is regularly present in the market."
