   "Banks are becoming increasingly vigilant in protecting customers from theft or scam. That’s why each transaction requires an OTP verification i.e. a digital code is sent to a mobile phone or an inbox to be used on the transaction platform.",
   "The interaction time on digital platforms is also really brief for safety, so the customer has to enter their login credentials to be able to continue banking."
